        <h1>Welcome To My Page</h1>
            <p>My name is <b>Brandon</b> and thank you for stopping by, this text is mainly a place holder for something
                that at some point
        might be relevant. Till then you are forced to read some stupid text that really does not matter, at all. I am
            the 2<sup>nd</sup> child of a wonderful woman named <b>Linda</b>. Growing up I drank a ton of soda, rarely
            did I consume H<sub>2</sub>O. <br/>We lived in a town called Newburgh:<br /> It is in New York. <br />
            Newburgh Sucks! <br/> So I left as soon as my legs were able to carry me away! <br/>

            </p><hr/><p>Don't get me wrong,
            the people I grew up with were wonderful and I miss many of my childhood friends, but have unfortunately
            lost touch with most of them.</p>

            <p><blockquote>If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn't part of ourselves
            dosen't disturb us.</blockquote> <br/>  -Herman Hesse
    <h2>Standard Sub Heading</h2>

        <p>This will be where I will shamelessly self promote myself and all of the amazing life accomplishments
                that
        I have...well accomplished.</p>
    <h2>For some reason this is where the sub-heading 2 goes.</h2>

        <p>Sub heading two information, actual real, tangible information.</p>
